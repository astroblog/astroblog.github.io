The Trifid Nebula, M20, is a beautiful gaseous cloud within which new stars are being born.  It is one of several spectacular telescopic sights embedded in the summer and autumn Milky Way.

The Trifid is is about 5,000 light-years away, 40 light-years across and a mere 300,000 years old. That makes it one of the youngest star forming regions in our sky, with newborn and embryonic stars embedded in its natal dust and gas clouds.

 The name Trifid means 'divided into three lobes'. The object is an unusual combination of an open cluster of stars; an emission nebula (the lower, red portion), a reflection nebula (the upper, blue portion) and a dark nebula (the apparent gaps within the emission nebula that cause the trifurcated appearance. Viewed through a small telescope, the Trifid Nebula is a bright and peculiar object, and is thus a perennial favorite of amateur astronomers.

{{% smalltext %}}One of my earlier  blog posts three years ago was also a look at the Trifid Nebula. 
It's interesting to compare the earlier image (a five-minute exposure) with the current one (51 minutes); 
click [here]({{< relref "2020-08-14-Trifid Nebula.md" >}}) to see it.{{% /smalltext %}}
