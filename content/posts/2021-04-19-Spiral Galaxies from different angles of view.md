Here are three different faint spiral galaxies that look quite different since we view them from different angles.  


<!--more-->
### First, NGC 1232 is a fairly faint galaxy that we view completely face-on.
NGC 1232 is about 70 million light years away from us, meaning that the photons of light that I captured with my telescope and camera were emitted by stars in the galaxy back when dinosaurs were still roaming the earth. And light travels at the speed of 186000 miles **PER SECOND**. Galaxies are mind-bogglingly far away!

This galaxy contains millions of stars arranged in several spiral arms with dark lanes in interstellar dust sprinkled between them. These spiral arms are curiously bent and not gently curved as in more typical galaxies. 

In addition, we see a satellite galaxy - NGC 1232A. This is somewhat reminiscent of the Whirlpool galaxy and its satellite neighbor. Click

### And finally, NGC 891 is a fine spiral galaxy that we see edge-on.
It looks rather like the popular image of a flying saucer.
We see the typical bulge around the galaxy nucleus and a definite 
dark dust lane at the galaxy equator, bisecting the spindle that we view. 
It is sometimes referred to as the Silver Sliver Galaxy.
 NGC 891 is about 30 million light years away from us.

If we could travel across space and time to see our own galaxy from the outside looking in, it would probably look a lot like 
NGC 891. Astronomer Sir Patrick Moore once said that the galaxy looks like “two fried eggs clapped back to back.”
