The Helix Nebula is a stunning example of a planetary nebula -â€” a glowing shell of ionized gas expelled by a dying star. 
The star expels its outer layers of gas, leaving only its small, hot core. Radiation from the core energizes that gas, causing it to glow in a rainbow of colors. About 650 light-years away, the Helix is one of the closest and brightest such nebulae.

The Helix Nebula's most distinctive feature is its circular appearance, resembling a colossal eye peering into the depths of space. 

Most astronomers think that the Helix is actually shaped like a barrel, and we happen to be looking through the top of it. The main ring is two or three light-years across, 
roughly equivalent to half the distance between our sun and its closest star. However, wispy material from the nebula spreads out at least twice that far into space from the central star.
Its age is estimated to be 10,600 years.

I shared an earlier picture of the Helix that I took three years ago.
