Here are three attractive galaxies that I was able to observe in the past week or so.  You will notice that even though they are all spiral galaxies, they exhibit strikingly different appearance.

M74 is a typical spiral galaxy with two clearly defined spiral arms.
It is about 35 million lightyears from us, and it
is estimated that M74 is home to about 100 billion stars.

Finally here is the Sculptor Galaxy, a spiral galaxy that is tilted closer to edge-on to our view. This galaxy is not a member of our local group of galaxies, but instead a member of the next-closest group. It is about 10 million lightyears distant.  The galaxy also gets its name from the constellation Sculptor in which it is located.

You can see that the Sculptor galaxy is dominated by patterns of mottled dust lanes and patches of great complexity that obscure stars behind them.
