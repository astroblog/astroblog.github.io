It's been three years since I last overhauled this website.  So here we go with a fresh makeover,
<!--more-->
Among the many changes are:
- We have a new shorter url address https://astroblog.github.io -- (the old url will still work and any requests sent there will be redirected to the new location).
- The fullscreen image experience is significantly improved
    - one click/tap on the button to enter fullscreen mode, and one click/tap on the fullscreen image to return to normal mode
    - can be used without complication on phones or tablets, although the full experience requires a full-size computer screen
- You can switch between normal mode and dark mode, triggered by the sun/moon icons in the top header
- There is a search facility, triggered by the magnifying glass in the top header
- You will notice blurred background images on the home page and on the post pages
- The underlying website architecture has changed (from Jekyll to Hugo). This allows these new features in addition to making the site easier to maintain.
