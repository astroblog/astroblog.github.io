Although I made this picture back in December, I thought it would be appropriate to wait and post it on Valentine's Day.

Since the Heart Nebula is a large object, larger than the field of view of my telescope/camera combination, I had to take four separate images offset from each other and then combine them together into a mosaic. This is the reason for the irregular edges.
