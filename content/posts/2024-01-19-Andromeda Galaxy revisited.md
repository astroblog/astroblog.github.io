The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way.
It is visible to the naked eye as a faint smudge on a dark moonless night; it is impressive in a small telescope; but it takes a long exposure photograph to reveal its full extent and structure.

Its tightly wound spiral arms harbor countless stars and cosmic dust. This image captures some of the intricate details of these spiral arms.

- M31 is approximately 2.5 million light-years away. It is closer and hence  appears larger than any other galaxy (apart from the two Magellanic Clouds visible only from the southern hemisphere that are small satellites of our Milky Way). And it is on a collision course with us and will collide with our Milky Way in about four billion years.

- Like the Milky Way with its Magellanic Cloud satellites,  M31 has two prominent satellite galaxies, M32 and M110. M32, a compact elliptical galaxy, appears as a distinctive celestial companion, nestled near the heart of Andromeda.  M110, a larger elliptical galaxy, graces the frame with its glow, extending the canvas beyond the M31.
 
 - NGC 206 is a star cloud contained within a spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy. It is the richest and most conspicuous such cloud and contains hundreds of new and extremely bright stars.

{{% smalltext %}}I shared an earlier picture of the Andromeda Galaxy that I took nearly four years ago.
You can click [here]({{< relref "2020-05-29-The Andromeda Galaxy.md" >}})
to revisit that post. That one was a 5 minute exposure -- you can see how much more detail shows up in the recent 60 minute exposure!{{% /smalltext %}}
