The Orion Nebula M42 is the most spectacular deep-sky object visible through almost any telescope.  Other than the moon, there is no other object in the night sky that reveals as much detail as M42.  It is visible to the naked eye as the fuzzy central star in Orion's sword.

The sci-fi thriller “Severance” is about an enigmatic, cultlike company and its “severed” employees, whose brains have been surgically divided into an “innie” work consciousness and an “outie” home one. The show itself has a kind of bifurcated existence, becoming Apple TV+’s most popular series ever while inspiring fans in the non-TV world to spin fanciful theories — some of which have been borne out — and otherwise wallow in its imagery and mysteries.
