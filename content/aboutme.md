I am a retired computer programmer living in North Carolina, and a long-time astronomy buff. I started exploring the night sky as a teenager back in the 1950s after saving up my paper route money to buy a 4-inch reflecting telescope. ($49.95 was a lot of money in those days!) About seven years ago I acquired an astro camera to use with my 30 year old 8-inch Meade SCT telescope -- this allowed me to dabble around with EAA (Electronically Assisted Astronomy). EAA involves computers as well as optical equipment, and being very much a computer person, such a combination is right down my alley.  I'm also an amateur radio operator and became re-enthused about that hobby some 20 years ago when it became possible to marry my computer and my radio equipment together.

In January 2020 I got a new 8-inch Celestron RASA scope and a better astro camera.  The new RASA is photographically very "fast" (f/2) and I am AMAZED at what I can see and photograph compared to visually observing through my old f/10 SCT telescope.

I decided to set up this blog so I could share examples of what I see with family and friends.
