      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will overly tax your imagination to see why NGC 6357 is nicknamed the Lobster Nebula. Or perhaps you think it  resemblances a crab more?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Near the bright star Sadr (grossly over exposed in the image) at the center of the Northern Cross lies the Butterfly Nebula. Its nickname comes from its intricate shape that somewhat resembles a butterfly with its delicate wings outstretched.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as M51,
is a magnificent face-on spiral galaxy.
It is interacting with a smaller companion, NGC 5195, a dwarf galaxy connected to its larger neighbor by a tidal bridge of dust. The bridge is visible in the image silhouetted against the central region of the smaller galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the brighter nearby galaxies, NGC 2903 was somehow missed by comet hunter Charles Messier when he compiled his famous list of objects not to be mistaken for comets.  Nonetheless, this barred spiral is an attractive telescopic object.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-04-17-crab-nebula-revisited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;M1, the Crab Nebula, is the debris left by the death of a massive star when it exploded in a brilliant flash of light and energy nearly a thousand years ago.
We can see many intricate details in the remains left by that supernova &amp;ndash; wispy tendrils of gas and dust intertwine illuminated by the intense radiation emitted by the pulsar at its core.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-03-22-the-skull-nebula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Skull Nebula is another example of the remains left by a dying Sun-like star that has cast away its outer layers in a cosmic farewell, leaving behind hot, glowing complex shells of ionized gas.  I&amp;rsquo;ve shared examples before of these so-called planetary nebulae, but the Skull is a particularly appropriate nickname for such an object!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-03-01-the-jellyfish-nebula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Jellyfish Nebula gets its name from its striking resemblance to the graceful tendrils of a jellyfish swimming through the cosmic sea. It is a testament to the dynamic and chaotic nature of the universe, where destruction begets creation on a mind boggling scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is the closest spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way.
It is visible to the naked eye as a faint smudge on a dark moonless night; it is impressive in a small telescope; but it takes a long exposure photograph to reveal its full extent and structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-01-01-helix-revisited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Helix Nebula is a stunning example of a planetary nebula -— a glowing shell of ionized gas expelled by a dying star.
The star expels its outer layers of gas, leaving only its small, hot core. Radiation from the core energizes that gas, causing it to glow in a rainbow of colors. About 650 light-years away, the Helix is one of the closest and brightest such nebulae.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-11-03-wizard-nebula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wizard Nebula is a cosmic cloud surrounding open star cluster NGC 7380. Over the years it has earned its sorcerous nickname because of its similarity in appearance to a medieval magician in a pointed hat. (It does take a little imagination!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Tulip Nebula is a glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust and gets its name from the flower it appears to resemble in photographs.
While a pretty sight itself, the Tulip has an interesting neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-09-15-eagle-nebula-revisited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Eagle Nebula M16, one of the brightest night sky nebulae, is an area where stars are actively forming. It is filled with dark regions and globules, including a peculiar dark column named the &amp;ldquo;Stellar Spire&amp;rdquo;.
Of special note are the &amp;ldquo;Pillars of Creation&amp;rdquo; made famous by an early (1995) picture from the Hubble Space Telescope.
The pillars and spire are collapsing clouds of dust and gas being sculpted by intense starlight from  newly formed hot stars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never cease to be amazed at the imagination shown by astronomers over the years in coming up with names to attach to celestial nebulae.  Here is a look from last week at Thor&amp;rsquo;s Helmet, a hat shaped emission nebula with wing-like appendages, more formally known as NGC 2359.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Triangulum Galaxy (also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy or M33) is the third largest galaxy in our Local Group of galaxies (after the Milky Way and Andromeda). It is about three million lightyears away from us.  Hence we enjoy a better view of it than any other galaxy except Andromeda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-11-18-pelican-nebula-take-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pelican Nebula is an emission nebula whose outlines somewhat resemble the namesake bird.
The nebula’s appearance is defined by dark dust clouds that outline the pelican’s long bill and eye, and by bright clouds of ionized gas that form the curved shape of the pelican’s head and neck. The pelican&amp;rsquo;s body and wing are formed by a complex mixture of bright nebulosity intermixed with dark dust clouds, as is the pouch hanging down from the bill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Elephant&amp;rsquo;s Trunk Nebula (IC 1396A) is a twisted sinuous structure of interstellar gas and dust that we see back-lit and ionized by intense radiation coming from a nearby massive star. Red light from ionized hydrogen makes it stand out amid the other streams and swirls of dark nebulae.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh look at the wonderful Orion Nebula complex (M42 and M43) and the neighboring Running Man. Although I have shown both before, this new view shows how they are related to each other.  This is also a longer exposure than before and has been processed to reveal additional subtle detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh view showing both the Horsehead Nebula and the Flame Nebula, two celestial showpieces that are located quite close to each other in the constellation Orion.
This past week we had a night with exceptionally clear and transparent skies. I was able to image a couple of new objects as well as take a fresh look at some old favorites. Among my old favorites, I can&amp;rsquo;t resist reshowing the Horsehead and the Flame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The entire Veil Nebula (also known as the Cygnus Loop) is BIG - it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  My previous three posts were recent images of the three brightest parts of the complex.  Here I have mosaicked together five separate older images so you can see the individual parts in relation to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The planet Mars was closer to earth on October 6 than it will be anytime in the next 15 years.  The closer it is, the larger it appears and the more detail can be seen. Close also means bright &amp;ndash; if you go out in the evening just after dark these days, you will see Mars as the really bright red object in the southeast, brighter and redder than any other star or planet,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A week ago it was easily visible to the naked eye, but it has dimmed greatly since then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters and Messier 45, are an open star cluster containing hot middle-aged stars in the constellation Taurus. It is among the star clusters nearest to Earth and is the cluster most obvious to the naked eye in the night sky. Most people can see the 6 or 7 brightest stars that form a smallish &amp;ldquo;dipper&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; NOT to be confused with the Little Dipper (Ursa Minor constellation).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an update to my May 16 post.  The sky was clear and moonless last Friday night, so I was able to check back in on the M61 supernova. A month later, it has faded only a little bit.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that the &amp;ldquo;seeing&amp;rdquo; was better this night, so this image shows somewhat more detail in the galaxy compared to my earlier images.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is an interesting field of galaxies in the constellation Virgo.  The brightest is Messier 49, an elliptical galaxy.  It is perhaps five times larger than our Milky Way galaxy and about 60 million light years distant.  Since elliptical galaxies have no discernable structure, they just appear as fuzzy blobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen a picture of another galaxy, odds are that it was of this one, the Andromeda galaxy, also known as M31. At a distance of 2.54 million light years from us, it is closer and hence  appears larger than any other galaxy (apart from the two Magellanic Clouds in the southern hemisphere that are small satellites of our Milky Way). And it is on a collision course with us and will collide with our Milky Way in about four billion years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scattered mostly along the Milky Way are stellar groupings called open clusters, randomly shaped families of mostly young, hot stars that are all gravitationally bound to each other.  Most stars are born in such clusters, containing anything between perhaps twenty to a few thousand stars.  All of the stars in a given cluster are about the same age, having formed together from the same nebula.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are four representative Globular clusters.   Globular Clusters are gigantic spherical agglomerations of stars that surround the nucleus of our Milky Way galaxy.  Each globular cluster from hundreds of thousands to several million stars, and astronomers believe that the stars is most globular clusters are among the oldest stars in existance, perhaps as much as 10 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Comet C/2019 Y4 ATLAS has been a big disappointment.  It was discovered just four months ago, on December 28, 2019.  Initially it brightened much more quickly than expected, and there were hopes that it might reach naked-eye visibility in late May when it will pass closest to the sun and to the earth.  However its nucleus was observed to fragment by early April, and as a result it started getting dimmer instead of brighter. You can see pictures of the fragments taken by the Hubble Space Telescope by clicking on &lt;a href=&#34;https://astronomy.com/news/2020/05/hubble-captures-breakup-of-comet-atlas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;M94 is a face-on spiral galaxy whose spiral arms hug the middle and wind very tightly into the core. It is sometimes called the Cat&amp;rsquo;s Eye galaxy or the or Croc’s Eye Galaxy. It is about 16 million light years from the Earth. Around the brilliant circular disk is a ring of active star-forming regions, revealed in astrophotography as blue young star clusters. This artifact delineates it from the faded outer ring of an older yellowish stellar population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a face-on view of the barred spiral galaxy Messier 83, the southern pinwheel galaxy. (It is believed that our own Milky Way galaxy would look very much like M83 if we could view it from outside, although the Milky Way is about twice as large as M83 is.)  Notice the bright central nucleus, the well-formed  spiral arms, the central bar, and the dark dust lanes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sombrero Galaxy (also known as M104) is a lenticular galaxy about 31.1 million light-years) from Earth. The galaxy has a diameter of approximately 30% the size of the Milky Way. It has a bright nucleus, an unusually large central bulge, and a prominent dust lane in its inclined disk. The dark dust lane and the bulge give this galaxy the appearance of a sombrero hat. Its large bulge, its central supermassive black hole, and its dust lane all attract the attention of professional astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Christmas Tree Cluster was named for its triangular shape, formed by a cluster of very young stars,  that looks like a tree in visible light. The bright variable star S Monocerotis (near the bottom) marks the base of the Christmas tree and lights up the nearby nebulosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-03-horsehead-nebula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Horsehead Nebula consists of a cloud of ionized gas lit from within by young, hot stars; a dark cloud containing interstellar dust lies immediately in front. The dust absorbs the light from part of the ionized cloud. A portion of this dark cloud has a shape somewhat resembling a horse’s head. The nebula is located 1,300 light-years from the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Owl Nebula (also known Messier 97) is a planetary nebula located approximately 2,030 light years away in the constellation Ursa Major. When William Parsons observed the nebula in 1848, his hand-drawn illustration resembled an owl&amp;rsquo;s head. It has been known as the Owl Nebula ever since. The nebula is approximately 8,000 years old. It is approximately circular in cross-section with a little visible internal structure. The nebula is arranged in three concentric shells, with the outermost shell being about 20–30% larger than the inner shell. The owl-like appearance of the nebula is the result of an inner shell that is not circularly symmetric, but instead forms a barrel-like structure aligned at an angle of 45° to the line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;M51, better known as the Whirlpool Galaxy,
is a magnificent face-on spiral galaxy.
The Whirlpool Galaxy is interacting with a smaller companion, NGC 5195, a dwarf galaxy connected to its larger neighbour by a tidal bridge of dust. The bridge is visible in images of the pair silhouetted against the central region of the smaller galaxy. It lies at an approximate distance of 35  million light years from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
