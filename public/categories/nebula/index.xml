      <description>&lt;p&gt;NGC 2467, also known as the &amp;ldquo;Skull and Crossbones Nebula,&amp;rdquo; is a region where new stars are being born. Some people think it looks like a grinning skull, while others see the face of a colorful mandrill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will overly tax your imagination to see why NGC 6357 is nicknamed the Lobster Nebula. Or perhaps you think it  resemblances a crab more?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Near the bright star Sadr (grossly over exposed in the image) at the center of the Northern Cross lies the Butterfly Nebula. Its nickname comes from its intricate shape that somewhat resembles a butterfly with its delicate wings outstretched.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;M1, the Crab Nebula, is the debris left by the death of a massive star when it exploded in a brilliant flash of light and energy nearly a thousand years ago.
We can see many intricate details in the remains left by that supernova &amp;ndash; wispy tendrils of gas and dust intertwine illuminated by the intense radiation emitted by the pulsar at its core.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://hgastro.github.io/posts/2024-03-01-the-jellyfish-nebula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Jellyfish Nebula gets its name from its striking resemblance to the graceful tendrils of a jellyfish swimming through the cosmic sea. It is a testament to the dynamic and chaotic nature of the universe, where destruction begets creation on a mind boggling scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://hgastro.github.io/posts/2024-01-01-helix-revisited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Helix Nebula is a stunning example of a planetary nebula -— a glowing shell of ionized gas expelled by a dying star.
The star expels its outer layers of gas, leaving only its small, hot core. Radiation from the core energizes that gas, causing it to glow in a rainbow of colors. About 650 light-years away, the Helix is one of the closest and brightest such nebulae.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://hgastro.github.io/posts/2023-11-03-wizard-nebula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wizard Nebula is a cosmic cloud surrounding open star cluster NGC 7380. Over the years it has earned its sorcerous nickname because of its similarity in appearance to a medieval magician in a pointed hat. (It does take a little imagination!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://hgastro.github.io/posts/2023-10-15-the-tulip-nebula/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Tulip Nebula is a glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust and gets its name from the flower it appears to resemble in photographs.
While a pretty sight itself, the Tulip has an interesting neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://hgastro.github.io/posts/2023-09-15-eagle-nebula-revisited/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Eagle Nebula M16, one of the brightest night sky nebulae, is an area where stars are actively forming. It is filled with dark regions and globules, including a peculiar dark column named the &amp;ldquo;Stellar Spire&amp;rdquo;.
Of special note are the &amp;ldquo;Pillars of Creation&amp;rdquo; made famous by an early (1995) picture from the Hubble Space Telescope.
The pillars and spire are collapsing clouds of dust and gas being sculpted by intense starlight from  newly formed hot stars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never cease to be amazed at the imagination shown by astronomers over the years in coming up with names to attach to celestial nebulae.  Here is a look from last week at Thor&amp;rsquo;s Helmet, a hat shaped emission nebula with wing-like appendages, more formally known as NGC 2359.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://hgastro.github.io/posts/2022-11-18-pelican-nebula-take-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pelican Nebula is an emission nebula whose outlines somewhat resemble the namesake bird.
The nebula’s appearance is defined by dark dust clouds that outline the pelican’s long bill and eye, and by bright clouds of ionized gas that form the curved shape of the pelican’s head and neck. The pelican&amp;rsquo;s body and wing are formed by a complex mixture of bright nebulosity intermixed with dark dust clouds, as is the pouch hanging down from the bill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Elephant&amp;rsquo;s Trunk Nebula (IC 1396A) is a twisted sinuous structure of interstellar gas and dust that we see back-lit and ionized by intense radiation coming from a nearby massive star. Red light from ionized hydrogen makes it stand out amid the other streams and swirls of dark nebulae.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh look at the wonderful Orion Nebula complex (M42 and M43) and the neighboring Running Man. Although I have shown both before, this new view shows how they are related to each other.  This is also a longer exposure than before and has been processed to reveal additional subtle detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a fresh view showing both the Horsehead Nebula and the Flame Nebula, two celestial showpieces that are located quite close to each other in the constellation Orion.
This past week we had a night with exceptionally clear and transparent skies. I was able to image a couple of new objects as well as take a fresh look at some old favorites. Among my old favorites, I can&amp;rsquo;t resist reshowing the Horsehead and the Flame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The entire Veil Nebula (also known as the Cygnus Loop) is BIG - it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  My previous three posts were recent images of the three brightest parts of the complex.  Here I have mosaicked together five separate older images so you can see the individual parts in relation to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Horsehead Nebula consists of a cloud of ionized gas lit from within by young, hot stars; a dark cloud containing interstellar dust lies immediately in front. The dust absorbs the light from part of the ionized cloud. A portion of this dark cloud has a shape somewhat resembling a horse’s head. The nebula is located 1,300 light-years from the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Orion Nebula M42 is the most spectacular deep-sky object visible through almost any telescope.  Other than the moon, there is no other object in the night sky that reveals as much detail as M42.  It is visible to the naked eye as the fuzzy central star in Orion&amp;rsquo;s sword.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
