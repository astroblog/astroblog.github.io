      <description>&lt;p&gt;Comet C/2019 Y4 ATLAS has been a big disappointment.  It was discovered just four months ago, on December 28, 2019.  Initially it brightened much more quickly than expected, and there were hopes that it might reach naked-eye visibility in late May when it will pass closest to the sun and to the earth.  However its nucleus was observed to fragment by early April, and as a result it started getting dimmer instead of brighter. You can see pictures of the fragments taken by the Hubble Space Telescope by clicking on &lt;a href=&#34;https://astronomy.com/news/2020/05/hubble-captures-breakup-of-comet-atlas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
