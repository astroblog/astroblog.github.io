Most of the detailed images you’ll find online were taken in the Southern Hemisphere, like in Chile or Australia, where it appears much higher in the sky.\nThe Skull and Crossbones Nebula is a stellar nursery located about 13,000 light-years from Earth.\nNGC 2467 (also catalogued as Sh2-311) is actually not a single open cluster surrounded by nebulosity as was originally thought, but is a superposition of very different stellar objects along our line of sight. The nebula contains the very young open clusters Haffner 18 and Haffner 19, the latter is surrounded by a bright red circular object.\nThe bright star HD 64315 is the powerhouse of this nebula. Its intense radiation sculpts the surrounding gas, shaping the structure of the nebula over time. Without this massive star, the nebula wouldn’t look the way it does today.\nThose dark splotches visible throughout the nebula are Bok Globules, regions where dust is so tightly packed that light from embedded stars cannot get out. Over time, the powerful radiation from massive stars like HD 64315 will erode and reshape these globules, revealing what’s inside.\nAbout the nicknames #\rI rotated my image (with South at the top) to highlight what I think looks most like a skull. Personally, I don’t see any crossbones!\nOther people turn the nebula and clusters back right side up, and say that the cluster Haffner 19 marks the right eye of the Skull Nebula and the bright star HD64455 marks the left eye.\nSome observers liken its appearance to the face of a long-snouted mandrill monkey.\nWhat do you see?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a word you probably didn\u0026rsquo;t know #\rPareidolia, the tendency for perception to impose a meaningful interpretation on a visual stimulus, so that one detects an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none. Common examples include perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations; seeing faces in inanimate objects; or lunar pareidolia like the Man in the Moon.\nI only came across the word \u0026ldquo;pareidolia\u0026rdquo; just recently, but it turns out I’ve been talking about it all along!

I started exploring the night sky as a teenager back in the 1950s after saving up my paper route money to buy a 4-inch reflecting telescope. ($49.95 was a lot of money in those days!) About six years ago I acquired an astro camera to use with my 30 year old 8-inch Meade SCT telescope \u0026ndash; this allowed me to dabble around with EAA (Electronically Assisted Astronomy). EAA usually involves computers as well as optical equipment, and being very much a computer person, such a combination is right down my alley. I\u0026rsquo;m also an amateur radio operator (callsign K7JNX) and became re-enthused about that hobby 18 years ago when it became possible to marry my computer and my radio equipment together.\nIn January 2020 I got a new 8-inch Celestron RASA scope and a better astro camera. The new RASA is photographically very \u0026ldquo;fast\u0026rdquo; (f/2) and I am AMAZED at what I can see and photograph compared to visually observing through my old f/10 SCT telescope.\nI decided to set up this blog to let me share some examples of what I see with family and friends.\nAbout the Pictures on this Blog #\rNone of these pictures were taken using a large telescope or from a remote dark sky site. Instead, they are all taken from my light-polluted backyard surrounded by nearby street lights and neighbors\u0026rsquo; security lights.\nUnless otherwise mentioned, all these images were taken using my Celestron RASA 8-inch astrograph (telescope) and a ZWO ASI183MC one-shot color camera. Originally I used an iOptron AZ Mount Pro alt-azimuth mount, but in 2023 I started using an iOptron HAE29ec equatorial mount. Image acquisition is controlled using software programs Sharpcap or NINA.\nI principally process the raw images originally using a program named Startools and later one named Siril. The earliest images I show on this blog are formed from multiple short exposures (typically 3 seconds) stacked together to reach a total exposure of between 3 and 30 minutes. My more recent blog posts show images taken with longer total exposures, typically 30 to 90 minute stacks of 20 second exposures.\nA mini computer rides on my telescope to control the telescope and camera and it communicates with my main computer inside the house. I can see a detailed image in real time on my main computer screen (inside the house and away from the mosquitos or cold) and can watch the results improve as multiple exposures are taken and stacked together to produce a better image with less noise. And I can aim and focus the telescope remotely from the comfort of my study.\nI should note that processing astronomical images to tease out as much subtle detail as possible is very much an art. Having only been doing this for a few years, I\u0026rsquo;m very much still in the \u0026ldquo;neophyte\u0026rdquo; category.\nAbout Electronically Assisted Astronomy #\rEAA allows amateur astronomers to observe objects in less than ideal conditions, especially under badly light polluted skies, or even when a bright Moon is present. Deep-sky celestial objects which are unimpressive or all but invisible in an eyepiece from urban or suburban skies easily become visible, with considerable detail, and in full color. By some informal estimates, EAA with a relatively inexpensive camera has the same effect as tripling telescope aperture for a visual observer without the drawbacks of a large bulky telescope. EAA is also ideal for us older observers whose visual acuity is not what it used to be.\nAbout Astrophotography #\rAfter I spent a couple of years exploring and sampling what the sky has to offer using EAA, I evolved into spending more and more time doing longer-exposure astrophotography. Most of the images I\u0026rsquo;ve shared in the past couple of years have involved exposures between 30 and 90 minutes and then more extensive post-processing afterwards. Some really impressive free software has recently come on the scene to facilitate final results, and learning to use it has been an ongoing endeavor. I should mention Siril, Sirilic, Graxpert, Cosmic Clarity, Astrosharp and Affinity Photo in this regard.\nI\u0026rsquo;m truly living in the golden age of amateur astrophotography \u0026ndash; and still have a lot to learn!\nIf you have any questions or would like to share any comments, you can click here to email me: howardgrams@yahoo.com #\rLet me know if you\u0026rsquo;d like to be on the list to receive a short email notification whenever I add new entries to this blog.\n","date":"January 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Suburban Backyard Astro Sights","summary":"","title":"About Me ","type":"page"},{"content":"iogjoigfdj o98o 9i4y3 09tyeru098ertq oti 9ioerjt0iu itu0it j09irge o ighoierug oijroi\nThis is supposed to be a title\nThis is one we can style\rMore thus and so.","date":"January 1, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/testpage/","section":"Suburban Backyard Astro Sights","summary":"","title":"Test Page","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"December 14, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ngc6357/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ngc6357","type":"tags"},{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t think it will overly tax your imagination to see why NGC 6357 is nicknamed the Lobster Nebula.

However, its extremely faint glow requires long-exposure imaging to reveal its true beauty.\nThe nebula is a vast cloud of gas and dust, a stellar nursery where new stars are born. One of the most massive stars known is found at the very heart of the Lobster. It is one of many in the region, and their intense ultraviolet radiation ionizes the hydrogen, causing it to emit the iconic reddish glow we see in the image.\nThe massive stars within NGC 6357 are crucial to the lifecycle of the universe. These stars live fast and die young, ending their lives in supernova explosions that spread heavy elements like carbon and oxygen -— ingredients essential for life.\nInterestingly enough, nearby in the sky is similar stellar wonder, the Cat’s Paw Nebula, which I shared my image of last month.

(Not recommended on phone or small tablet.)\rThe Butterfly is officially cataloged as IC 1318. Note some of the subtle yet intricate details.\nThis beautiful structure is an emission nebula, primarily made up of hydrogen gas.\nThe nebula’s \u0026ldquo;wings\u0026rdquo; are illuminated by the energy of light emitted by young, hot nearby embedded stars. When that starlight hits this gas, it excites the hydrogen atoms, causing them to emit light. This process is what gives emission nebulae like IC 1318 their characteristic reddish glow.\nUnlike many nebulae, the Butterfly Nebula doesn’t have a single dominant star at its core; instead, it represents a tapestry of stellar activity spread across several light-years.\nThe dark regions that carve out the butterfly\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;wings\u0026rdquo; are areas of dense interstellar dust. These dust clouds are so thick that they block the light from the stars behind them, creating stark, shadowy contrasts against the bright nebulous backdrop. These shadows add to the beauty and complexity of the nebula.\nThe Butterfly Nebula is part of a larger star-forming region in the Milky Way, a veritable nursery where new stars are born. The dark bands that crisscross the nebula are not gaps but dense clouds of interstellar dust that block the light behind them, creating a dramatic contrast against the glowing hydrogen gas. These dark lanes are a stark reminder of the complex interplay between light and shadow in the universe.\nWhat’s fascinating about IC 1318 is its scale and context. It lies about 5,000 light-years from Earth, stretching across an area larger than the full moon in the night sky.

The bright colors come from the gases within the nebula, especially hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, each emitting light at different wavelengths. The bluish-green areas are rich in oxygen, while the red and pink areas indicate hydrogen and nitrogen.\nAt the center of the nebula is a small white dwarf, the hot, dense core of the original star that once existed here. This white dwarf emits intense ultraviolet light that makes the gases in the nebula glow brightly. The gas cloud of a planetary nebula keeps expanding until it dissipates into the surrounding space.

It becomes hotter and unstable, giving the nebula’s ring a brighter and sharper appearance and producing an asymmetric appearance. The material on the nebula’s trailing edge expands freely.\nNGC 246 (92 min total exposure Jan 11, 2024)\n(Click here To show image full size, press ESC To Return.) The Skull Nebula is located about 1600 light-years away from us. It is a fairly small object \u0026ndash; it would take about eight of them lined up side by side to equal the apparent width of the full moon. It is relatively old for a planetary nebula, about 6,600 years.\nOnce the dying star has lost all of its atmosphere, the intense ultraviolet radiation from its exposed luminous core ionizes the expelled material, causing the gas to glow as a bright planetary nebula. The central star of NGC 246 illuminates the expanding clouds of material and will continue to do so for a few more millennia. Eventually, it will cool down and fade, and the clouds of gas and dust will disappear into the interstellar medium.\nNote the two radically-different common ways for stars to die and leave behind interesting remnants for us to see:\nOne process is via a supernova explosion where the star\u0026rsquo;s remnants are cast violently away into space. This happens to large, high mass stars. My previous image, that of the Jellyfish Nebula was an example of one such.\nThe other process happens to low to intermediate-mass stars. They evolve into red giants near the end of their life cycles. The Skull is an example of this process, a gentle and slow puffing up of stellar material, where layers are cast away to leave behind a hot, glowing stellar remnant. The star loses mass through a strong stellar wind, and the expelled material forms the nebula’s outer shells. As the central red giant continues to lose material, it becomes surrounded by increasingly complex shells of ionized gas. (Our sun in an example of such a star; it will die via this process in about five billion years.)\n","date":"March 22, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-03-22-the-skull-nebula/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe Skull Nebula is another example of the remains left by a dying Sun-like star that has cast away its outer layers in a cosmic farewell, leaving behind hot, glowing complex shells of ionized gas.

Spoiler alert: Yes I can!\nUnlike the older Hubble Space Telescope that orbits the earth just 340 miles over our heads and is visible with the naked eye, the JWST is MUCH further away, about 930,000 miles, or nearly 3000 times further than Hubble or four times further than the moon. The part of Webb that faces the earth, the reflective sunshield, is 70 x 45 feet in size. As seen from earth then, the JWST sunshield looks as big as a dime in Chicago would look if viewed from Boston! Obviously we can\u0026rsquo;t see something that small, but we CAN hope to see sunlight reflected off that sunscreen. The question is, how dim will it be?\nEarly discussion of this question among amateur astronomers (e.g. here) suggested that the James Webb would appear as bright as a 16th to 18th magnitude star. (Higher numbers mean dimmer.) An 18th magnitude star is 63000 times dimmer than the faintest star visible to the naked eye in a dark rural sky!\nHowever, since my telescope/camera combination can reach as dim as 18th magnitude, I resolved to give it a go.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my most recent result, showing a trail left by JWST moving south to north in front of the background stars:\nJames Webb Space Telescope (26 min total exposure Sep 21, 2022)\nWhat I did was aim my telescope at the point in the sky where JWST was supposed to be at that date and time (1:07 AM on Sep 21). Wanting to produce a distinctive pattern, I exposed for 8 minutes, then covered the camera for 2 minutes, then exposed for 6 more minutes, then covered the camera for 6 minutes and then finally exposed for 12 more minutes. That distinctive pattern was to demonstrate that any trail I got near the predicted spot was indeed the JWST and not just a random meteor or satellite.\nSo how faint was it? #\rHere\u0026rsquo;s part of the same image with an overlay (using a program named ASTAP) that shows selected star magnitudes (omitting the decimal point). The JWST trail seems a little dimmer than nearby 17.3 or 17.5 magnitude stars and brighter than nearby 18.1 and 18.3 magnitude stars.

One can generate an ephemeris (a table of dates, times and positions in the sky) from this NASA website for the JWST. It also indicates which direction JWST appears to move and how fast.\nSince the JWST sunshield is not a perfect mirror nor a diffuse reflector, it is expected that the brightness perceived from earth will vary from time to time.

It lies roughly 1,300 light-years from Earth. At some 30 to 40 light-years in diameter, this great big nebulous cocoon is giving birth to perhaps a thousand stars. But most of the stars in this emerging cluster are hidden behind the nebula itself. M43 is actually a part of M42 but was assigned a separate identifier because in early telescopes it looked like a separate object.\nThe Nebula is part of a much larger nebula that is known as the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. The Orion Molecular Cloud Complex extends throughout the constellation of Orion and includes the Horsehead Nebula and the Flame Nebula. Observers have given names to various features in the Orion Nebula. The dark lane that extends from the north toward the bright region is called the \u0026ldquo;Fish\u0026rsquo;s Mouth\u0026rdquo;. The illuminated regions to both sides are called the \u0026ldquo;Wings\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Running Man (sometimes called the Ghost Nebula) vaguely resembles the shape of a man sprinting, with his huge arms in motion. The Running Man nebula comprises three separate reflection nebulae, NGC 1973, NGC 1975, and NGC 1977 that are divided by darker regions that form the man himself.\nReflection nebulae don\u0026rsquo;t emit light of their own, instead they are made of dust that is lit up by nearby embedded young stars.\ndate: 2022-03-01 title: \u0026ldquo;The Orion Nebula and the Running Man\u0026rdquo; categories:\nnebula tags: m42 m43 ngc1973 ngc1975 ngc1977 date: 2022-03-01 title: \u0026ldquo;The Orion Nebula and the Running Man\u0026rdquo; categories:\nnebula tags: m42 m43 ngc1973 ngc1975 ngc1977 date: 2022-03-01 title: \u0026ldquo;The Orion Nebula and the Running Man\u0026rdquo; categories:\nnebula tags: m42 m43 ngc1973 ngc1975 ngc1977 date: 2022-03-01 title: \u0026ldquo;The Orion Nebula and the Running Man\u0026rdquo; categories:\nnebula tags: m42 m43 ngc1973 ngc1975 ngc1977 date: 2022-03-01 title: \u0026ldquo;The Orion Nebula and the Running Man\u0026rdquo; categories:\nnebula tags: m42 m43 ngc1973 ngc1975 ngc1977 The four brightest stars at the heart of the Orion Nebula are known as The Trapezium.

When they reach the end of their life cycle, they expel their outer gaseous layers to form the nebula, which is then heated by the hot core of the central white dwarf. This will be the fate of our Sun in roughly five billion years.\nHence, the Dumbbell consists of very rarified gas that has been ejected from the hot central star (visible on this photo). The gas atoms in the nebula are heated by the intense ultraviolet radiation from this star and emit strongly at specific visible colors.\nThe gas cloud of a planetary nebula keeps expanding until it dissipates into the surrounding space. Measurements of the size of the nebula over time suggest that it is about three to four thousand years old. In another ten thousand years it will have faded to invisibility.

These stars are only a million or so years old – babies on the scale of star lifetimes.\nAlthough it actually part of the same nebula, the separate smaller region at the top of this image has the designation M43 and looks like a separate object through a small telescope.
